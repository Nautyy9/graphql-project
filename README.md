# Fullstack MERN Project with GraphQL

This is a fullstack project built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and GraphQL. Both the frontend and backend parts are built on top of TypeScript, and the server-side GraphQL queries are executed using GraphiQL.

## Technologies Used
#### MongoDB:
 A NoSQL document database used to store data
####  Express: 
A web application framework used to create the backend API
####  React:
 A frontend library used to build the user interface
####  Node.js:
 A server-side JavaScript runtime used to run the backend code
####  GraphQL:
 A query language for APIs used to retrieve and manipulate data
####  Apollo Server:
 A GraphQL server used to connect the frontend and backend
####  Apollo Client:
 A GraphQL client used to send queries and mutations to the server
####  TypeScript:
 A typed superset of JavaScript used to provide type bindings
####  GraphiQL:
 A graphical interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE used to execute server-side ####  GraphQL queries

## Functionality
The project provides the following CRUD functionality:
 #### Create:
Allows the user to add new items to the database
####  Read:
Allows the user to retrieve data from the database
####  Update:
Allows the user to modify existing data in the database
####  Delete:
Allows the user to remove items from the database

The project also provides type bindings using TypeScript. This helps to ensure that the correct data types are used throughout the application, which can help to prevent bugs and improve code quality.

Server-side GraphQL queries are executed using GraphiQL, which provides an interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE for testing and debugging. This makes it easy to inspect the schema and data, and to test queries before using them in the frontend.
